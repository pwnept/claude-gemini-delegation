# Implementation Guide: Claude Pro + CLI Delegation (Revised)

## Quick Start (2 Hours)

### Step 1: Validate CLI Access (30 min)

```bash
# Test 1: Gemini CLI works
which gemini-cli || echo "Gemini CLI not found"
gemini-cli --version

# Test 2: GitHub Copilot CLI works
which gh copilot || gh extension install github/gh-copilot
gh copilot explain "SELECT * FROM users"

# Test 3: Create test context file
cat > /tmp/test_refactor.md << 'EOF'
## Refactor Task
Source file: src/api.js
Current: Uses old callback pattern
Target: Convert to async/await
Lines: 150-200
EOF

# Test 4: Invoke Gemini with context
gemini-cli --input /tmp/test_refactor.md \
           --output /tmp/test_result.md \
           --model gemini-2.5-pro

# Test 5: Check token usage in Claude Code
# (Open Claude Code, paste this, measure tokens)
# "Read /tmp/test_result.md and summarize"
# Should be <3K tokens
```

**Success = All 5 tests pass ✓**

---

### Step 2: Build Routing Decision File (1 hour)

Create `~/.claude/ORCHESTRATION_RULES.md`:

```markdown
# Orchestration Decision Rules for Claude Code

## RULE SET: When to Delegate vs. Keep in Claude

### Rule 1: Token Volume (Most Important)
IF task.inputTokenCount > 25000 AND task.type in ['refactor', 'test_gen', 'audit', 'docs']
  THEN delegate to CLI (Gemini or Copilot)
ELSE IF task.inputTokenCount < 8000
  THEN keep in Claude (overhead not worth it)
ELSE → continue to Rule 2

### Rule 2: Interaction Pattern
IF task requires multiple rounds of refinement (interactive)
  THEN keep in Claude (latency of delegation kills UX)
ELSE → continue to Rule 3

### Rule 3: Code Quality Criticality
IF task.category in ['security_audit', 'production_refactor', 'generated_code']
  THEN keep in Claude (need 100% visibility, full audit trail)
ELSE → delegate to CLI

### Rule 4: Task Type Suitability for CLI
IF task.type in ['refactor', 'test_gen', 'documentation', 'static_analysis']
  THEN delegate (CLI tools excel here)
ELSE IF task.type in ['architecture', 'complex_reasoning', 'novel_problem']
  THEN keep in Claude (need deep reasoning)
ELSE → delegate (default is CLI for large tasks)

## DECISION FLOW

```
User submits task
    ↓
Measure: inputTokenCount, type, interactivity
    ↓
Apply Rule 1 (token volume)
    ├─ >25K + right type? → DELEGATE
    ├─ <8K? → KEEP
    └─ else → Rule 2
       ↓
    Apply Rule 2 (interaction)
       ├─ Interactive? → KEEP
       └─ Async? → Rule 3
          ↓
       Apply Rule 3 (criticality)
          ├─ Critical? → KEEP
          └─ else → Rule 4
             ↓
          Apply Rule 4 (type)
             ├─ Suitable for CLI? → DELEGATE
             └─ else → KEEP
```

## IMPLEMENTATION IN CLAUDE CODE

When creating a task, evaluate it:

```
Based on ORCHESTRATION_RULES.md:
- Input tokens: [count]
- Task type: [classification]
- Interactivity: [yes/no]
- Criticality: [level]

Decision: [KEEP | DELEGATE]
Reason: [which rule triggered]

If DELEGATE:
  Invoke: gemini-cli --input [file] --output [result]
  Validate: [checklist]

If KEEP:
  Process in Claude directly
```

## FAILURE MODES & FALLBACK

If delegation fails:
1. Check: /tasks/[taskid]_result.md exists and is non-empty
2. Validate: No error patterns in output
3. If validation fails:
   - Log error to /tasks/[taskid]_audit.md
   - Retry with monolithic Claude (use KEEP strategy)
   - Notify user: "CLI delegation failed, using backup method"
```

**Save and commit this file to your project.**

---

### Step 3: Create Validation Template (30 min)

Create `~/.claude/VALIDATION_GATES.md`:

```markdown
# Post-Delegation Validation Checklist

After CLI returns a result, Claude Code validates:

## Gate 1: File Integrity
□ Result file exists
□ File size > 100 bytes (not empty)
□ File is readable (no permissions issues)

FAIL → Log to audit, retry

## Gate 2: Structure Check
□ Output matches expected format
   - If expecting code: has function defs, imports
   - If expecting docs: has headings, content
   - If expecting tests: has test cases
□ No placeholder text ("TODO", "FIX", "IMPLEMENT")
□ No error messages ("ERROR", "FAILED", "UNABLE")

FAIL → Log to audit, ask Claude to reformat

## Gate 3: Content Validation
□ Output length reasonable (20-200% of input)
□ If code: syntax is valid (pass through linter)
□ If refactor: maintains function signatures
□ No security red flags (SQL injection, XSS patterns)

FAIL → Log to audit, manual review required

## Gate 4: Quality Sample Check
□ Spot-check 3 random sections for quality
□ No obvious logic errors
□ Code style matches project conventions
□ Comments are clear and accurate

FAIL → Log to audit, discuss with user

## If ANY Gate Fails

Output this to user:
```
⚠️ Validation Failed

Gate: [which gate]
Issue: [specific problem]
Evidence: [sample output]

Options:
1. Retry with monolithic Claude (full context, slower)
2. Retry CLI with different parameters
3. Manual fix and continue
```

Which would you prefer?
```

## Success Criteria

✓ All gates pass → Return result confidently
✓ 3/4 gates pass → Return with confidence note
⚠️ 2/4 gates pass → Return with warning, offer fallback
❌ 0-1 gates pass → Don't return, offer fallback only
```

---

### Step 4: Add to Claude Code Project (Done!)

In your Claude Code project, create a `.claude` directory structure:

```
.claude/
├── orchestrators/
│   ├── ORCHESTRATION_RULES.md      (just created)
│   └── VALIDATION_GATES.md         (just created)
├── tasks/
│   └── [future results will go here]
└── logs/
    └── [delegation logs]
```

Add to your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Delegation Strategy

This project uses hybrid orchestration:

1. **Orchestrator**: Claude Code (interactive decisions)
2. **Heavy Lifting**: Gemini CLI (large refactoring, tests)
3. **Routing Rules**: Read `.claude/orchestrators/ORCHESTRATION_RULES.md`
4. **Validation**: Use `.claude/orchestrators/VALIDATION_GATES.md`

When delegating:
- Write input to `/tasks/[taskid]_input.md`
- Invoke: `gemini-cli --input /tasks/[taskid]_input.md --output /tasks/[taskid]_result.md`
- Read result file
- Validate using VALIDATION_GATES
- Return to user

Example:
```
User: "Refactor src/api.js to async/await (50K tokens)"

Claude thinks: 
  - Token count: ~55K ✓
  - Type: refactor ✓
  - Interactive: No ✓
  → Decision: DELEGATE

Claude acts:
  - Writes task context to /tasks/api_refactor_input.md
  - Runs: gemini-cli --input /tasks/api_refactor_input.md --output /tasks/api_refactor_result.md
  - Reads /tasks/api_refactor_result.md (~8K tokens)
  - Validates using gates (all pass ✓)
  - Returns: "[Refactored code from Gemini CLI, validated]"

User gets result in ~3-5 seconds, Claude used ~63K tokens total (vs 55K monolithic)
```
```

---

## Measuring Success (Week 1)

Track these metrics:

### Token Consumption
```bash
# Create a log sheet
Week 1 Tasks:
- Task 1: 50K input, delegated, used 62K total (+12%) vs. 50K monolithic
- Task 2: 8K input, kept in Claude, used 12K total
- Task 3: 45K input, delegated, used 51K total (+13%)

Average overhead: ~12% (vs. 15x with subagents)
```

### Reliability
```
Delegations: 5
Success rate: 5/5 (100%)
Failed validations: 0
User issues: 0
Fallback invocations: 0
```

### Latency
```
Monolithic Claude: 1-2 seconds per task
CLI delegation: 1.5-3 seconds per task (with validation)
Overhead: Minimal (MCP-CLI pattern is fast)
```

### Daily Budget
```
Claude Pro limit: ~500K tokens/day
Baseline (monolithic): ~580K for 10 × 50K tasks → OVER
With delegation: ~620K (slightly over, but caching helps)
With caching: ~310K (50% reduction) → UNDER LIMIT ✓
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Gemini CLI Not Found
```bash
# Install Google AI Pro CLI
# https://ai.google.dev/cli

# Or test with fallback (GitHub Copilot)
gh copilot suggest "refactor this code"
```

### Problem: Result File Missing
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la /tasks/[taskid]_result.md

# Check if Gemini CLI encountered an error
gemini-cli --version
# If failed: reinstall

# Fallback: Use monolithic Claude
# Claude will reprocess without delegation
```

### Problem: Token Consumption Still High
```
If averaging >1.5x vs. monolithic:
1. Check: Are you delegating tasks <10K tokens? (Don't; overhead not worth it)
2. Check: Are subagents still active? (Disable them)
3. Check: MCP tools still loaded? (Switch to code execution pattern)

Root cause: Likely still using old multi-agent-mcp approach
Solution: Verify ORCHESTRATION_RULES.md is being followed
```

### Problem: Validation Always Fails
```
Check your VALIDATION_GATES.md criteria:
- Are gates too strict? (e.g., requiring 100% matches)
- Is CLI output in different format? (adjust parser)
- Is CLI failing silently? (check /tasks/[taskid]_result.md content)

Temporary fix: Loosen gates to learn system behavior
```

## Advanced: Prompt Caching Setup (Optional, -50% tokens)

If you migrate to Claude API in future:

```python
# With prompt caching enabled
client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))

def get_refactored_code_cached(codebase):
    # First request (cache miss)
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        max_tokens=2048,
        system=[
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "You are a code refactoring expert.",
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": f"Here is the codebase context:\n\n{codebase}",
                "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}  # Cache this
            }
        ],
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "Refactor to async/await"}
        ]
    )
    
    # Second request (cache hit = -90% tokens for context)
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        max_tokens=2048,
        system=[
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "You are a code refactoring expert.",
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": f"Here is the codebase context:\n\n{codebase}",
                "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}  # Cache hit
            }
        ],
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "Generate tests for the refactored code"}
        ]
    )
    
    # Result: First task costs 100%, second costs 10% (context already paid for)
```

**For now with Claude Pro: Use file-based caching (keep results in /tasks/cached/ directory)**
